# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

### 1. Scan/Photo of Sketches
```
Be sure to label the different versions so you can differentiate them in your discussion. 
If you choose to take a picture of your sketches, please make sure the texts are readable.

### 2. Version Differences
## Problem
- Hard to find popular manga
- The "following" button is confusing, the button doesn't change label when clicked
- Hard to find a way to unfollow a manga
### Solution v1:
- Move top viewed manga to the top so the user can see it clearly
- Change label "following" to "follow" and change the label to "unfollow" if the user already followed the manga
- Place delete button beside the manga to unfollow the manga
### Solution v2:
- Move popular manga list to categorized manga display
- Place the follow button on the right side, if the manga is already followed then display stat so the user can remember what chapter he/she is last time
- disable the ability to unfollow manga from profile altogether, the ability unfollowing manga will be only available at manga profile
### Solution v3:
- Show all manga, use filter to get the top viewed manga
- Remake the manga profile page, make the "follow" button more visible to user
- Keep using tick box but place the "delete" button on top of manga list, and add "mark as read" and "favorites" button
### 3. Selected Sketch
```
Please write a paragraph telling us about which design you picked for Parts B and C 
and why you selected it.
```

### 4. Design Rationale
```
Please write a paragraph expressing what you have learned from the contextual inquiry, 
and how it is reflected in your design.
```

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware
```
Please write what are the assumptions for the hardware on which your new design will be implemented, 
such as: screen size, screen resolution, on touch screen, via physical buttons, 
using accelerometer/gyroscope, using mouse, keyboard, etc. 
Please be specific with the required hardware and any other assumptions, 
like whether the screen is color or black and white, etch.
```
### 2. Users
```
Please write down the assumptions about your users. 
What level of experience do you expect? 
Who familiar with computers/gadget will they be? 
What ages? 
Are there any other factors about the users that will influence your design?
```

## Part C: Prototypes
We will work on this part together during the class on **March 22nd, 2019**, 10:00 AM - 12.30 PM. Therefore, prior to the class please complete all the above parts (A & B) beforehand accordingly.
